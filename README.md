# Pair Up

## Introduction
Pairup is a platform or system where users can collaborate based on their complementary skills, with the understanding that any profits generated from their joint efforts will be shared. It provides an opportunity for individuals with different skill sets to work together towards a common goal, leveraging their respective strengths to potentially create something profitable. And even if the project doesn't yield profits, it still serves as valuable experience and a portfolio piece for both parties involved. This is a backend project, built using Django, and DRF.
